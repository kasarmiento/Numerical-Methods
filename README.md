numerical-methods
=================

Tiny programs that calculate integrals using various numerical methods.

These methods were written using psuedo code from the book, "Numerical Mathematics and Computing" by E. Ward Cheney and David R. Kincaid. I wrote these programs for CS 301: Numerical Mathematics and Computing. This class was taught my professor Asha Khakpour, and it was one of my favourite computer science courses. I enjoyed this class because I showed me how computer science can simplify complicated math operations that I've learned in calculus. I also learned about the importance of projecting possible calculation errors due normalization and lost significant figures.
